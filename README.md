Introduction
Wayfare is a Web 3-based platform that allows transportation companies to sell bus tickets and for users to purchase them. By using Web 3 technologies we aim to completely cut off corruption involved in the industry by relying on digital ledgers for all transactions and rates.

Abstract
Users can create an account in which they can then deposit money in various currencies using either bank transfers or mobile money which is then converted to tokens. These tokens can then be used to buy or resell tickets, buy governance tokens, or buy into the company. Transport companies (eg. Power tools, UBZ) can register on the platform as a ticket seller and then list their destinations and prices. Once a certain amount of sales have been made, smart contracts can be used to transfer the money to the respective company then A transaction fee can be charged to both users and ticket providers All ticket sales can be recorded on the blockchain to prevent fakes and other forms of fraud. The conductor can scan the ticket of passengers when boarding on their phones when boarding the bus. The QR codes can have timestamps included so the generated code to be scanned only lasts for a certain amount of time Passengers without mobile phones can purchase tickets at the bus stop from agents.

Backend
The backend will be done in Mototoko and handle features such as secure login and signup. deposits and purchase of ICP tokens, governance tokens, and stocks

Frontend
The front end will have 2 parts, the web app and the mobile application. The web app is done in react The Mobile application will be made using Kotlin, the native language for Android development using the new and standardized Jetpack Compose framework that can compile to Android, IOS, and Javascript for the Web

Hackathon notes
Just like the other participants, allotted time was not sufficient hence why the mobile app was the most completed part
